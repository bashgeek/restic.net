We've just released [restic 0.9.6](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.9.6). For downloading the new release and see a more detailed list of important changes, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.9.6). If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the `self-update` command to automatically download and verify the new release.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new/choose) you encounter! Or just write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).
