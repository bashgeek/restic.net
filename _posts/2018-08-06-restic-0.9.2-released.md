title: "restic 0.9.2 released"
---

We've just released [restic 0.9.2](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.9.2). Among several fixes it includes support for "Application Keys" for BackBlaze B2, which can be restricted to a specific bucket and/or path (so you don't have to give restic access to all your files stored at B2).

For downloading the new release and see a more detailed list of important changes, head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.9.2). As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter! Or just write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net).
