After two months development we're proud to release [restic version 0.3.0](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

The most notable change is the addition of the `prune` and `forget` commands (we've covered them in [an earlier blog post]({{< relref "removing-snapshots.md" >}})) which allow removing backups from the repository according to configurable criteria. Since this was one of the most requested features, now that it is implemented there's really no excuse for not making backups any more!

The detailed change log can be found [in the release notes](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.3.0) or [on GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0).

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!
