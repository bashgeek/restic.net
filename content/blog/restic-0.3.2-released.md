A few days ago we've [released restic 0.3.1]({{< relref "restic-0.3.1-released.md" >}}), unfortunately that introduced a bug which let's restic panic when there is an error during backup. The details are described in GitHub issues [#699](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/699) and [#700](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/700).

So, here it is: [restic version 0.3.2](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/tag/v0.3.2).

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new) you encounter!
