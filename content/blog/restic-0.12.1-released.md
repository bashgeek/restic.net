We're proud to announce that [restic 0.12.1](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.12.1) has been released today! This release contains several small fixes for bugs and a few smaller enhancements.

For downloading the new release and to see a more detailed list of important changes, please head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.12.1). If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the `self-update` command to automatically download and verify the new release.

As always, thanks for [reporting any issues](https://github.com/restic/restic/issues/new/choose) you encounter! Or just write a post in [the forum](https://forum.restic.net). If you have the time, please let us know if the `CHANGELOG.md` file (also included in the release on GitHub) is helpful for you. We try hard to make it readable for users, so you do not have to follow the development in detail. Is it worth the effort? What do you think? Please answer in the forum below.
