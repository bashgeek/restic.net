A while back we've registered the domain `restic.net` and we're moving the
website from GitHub Pages to a dedicated hosting machine at
[https://restic.net](https://restic.net). Please update any links to the old website,
thanks!

<del>If you're subscribed to the RSS/Atom XML feed, you need to update the feed url
to [https://restic.net/feed.xml](https://restic.net/feed.xml).</del>

**Update:** When we migrated the website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) in 2020, the
feed changed from Atom at the above mentioned URL to RSS 2.0 at individual section
URLs, e.g. [https://restic.net/blog/index.xml](https://restic.net/blog/index.xml)
for the blog posts. Please update or verify the feed configuration in your reader
so you don't miss out on any new posts! :)
