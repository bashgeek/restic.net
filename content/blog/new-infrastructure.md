We wish you a happy new year 2019!

Our friends at [hosting.de](https://www.hosting.de) recently provided us with a dedicated server to host this website, the forum, and the [beta builder](https://beta.restic.net) for restic, and we've just moved everything over. Thank you very much for your support!

Please leave a comment in the forum in the thread for this announcement if there's anything broken for you.
